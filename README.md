# Polynomials
## Description
Play with different polynomials in the command line.

Enter polynomials with the form of the following regular expression:

`-? +<term>( +<operator> +<term>)*`

Some examples are:
- `0`
- `1 + x`
- `93 + x^4 + 256x^123 - 4x + 2x^2`
- `- 1       +   2x^5     +            3x^2`

After construction a lot can be done with polynomial objects (as seen in the `Polynomial.h` file)
